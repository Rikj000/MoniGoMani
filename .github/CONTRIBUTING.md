Installation instructions
------

We use `pipenv` for virtual environments. We install all packages and its dependencies using `pipenv`. Also we run all commands using `pipenv` to ensure we've the right dependencies and do not interfere with other environments or dependencies.

**To Install `pipenv` and the required packages**:
```bash
pip install pipenv

pipenv install --dev
```

**Try, and run for example all unit tests**:

```bash
pipenv run pytest -c pytest.ini tests/
```

Using pre-commit hooks
------

This project uses a set of git commit hooks to help us developers to write ‚Äì *and more important, maintain* ‚Äì code mostly in the same style & fashion. These hooks are configured in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` and can be run on your machine by using an automated [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) integration.

**Run pre-commit only at changed files:**

```bash
pipenv run pre-commit run --from-ref HEAD^^^ --to-ref HEAD
```

**Run pre-commit at all files:**

```bash
$ pipenv run pre-commit run --all

~/Projects/MoniGoMani(master) ¬ª pre-commit run --all

GitHub Action Workflows
------

GitHub Actions are used in order to run automated unit-tests against our code. These actions are triggered at push-events into main, development and feature/* branches. These actions are also triggered at every Pull Request so we all can see very quickly if something happened.

It can be quite handy to run a GitHub action workflow on your local machine. Well, [act](https://github.com/nektos/act) is your friend.
