## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
 - This Framework & Strategy are still experimental and under heavy development. It is not recommended running it live at this moment.
 - Always make sure to understand & test your MoniGoMani configuration until you trust it, before even thinking about going live!
 - I am in no way responsible for your live results! You are always responsible for your own MoniGoMani configuration!
 - MoniGoMani should always be [re-optimized](https://monigomani.readthedocs.io/Docs-MoniGoMani/#how-to-optimize-monigomani) after doing manual changes!
 - You need to [optimized](https://monigomani.readthedocs.io/Docs-MoniGoMani/#how-to-optimize-monigomani) your own copy of MoniGoMani while thinking logically, don't follow your computer blindly!

## Requirements
Make sure that you have all of the following available on your system before proceeding:

- [**Python3**](https://www.python.org/) - Python 3.8+ is required.
- [**Pip3**](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) - Package manager to install & manage Python packages.
- [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/downloads) - Software version management
- [**cURL**](https://curl.se/) - Command line data transferring through URLs, usually already installed
- [**Expect**](https://core.tcl-lang.org/expect/index) - A tool for automating interactive applications
- [**TA-Lib**](https://github.com/mrjbq7/ta-lib) - Technical Analysis Library written in C
- [**VSCodium**](https://vscodium.com/) - *(Optional)* A light weight open-source IDE that comes pre-installed with good color codes to make it easier to read `.json` and `.log` files & many more great features.

#### Additional Ubuntu requirements:
- [**Switch `sh` to `bash`**](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/442517) - Run `sudo dpkg-reconfigure dash`, this will ask whether you want dash to be the default system shell. Answer `No` (`Tab` then `Enter`) and bash will become the default instead.
- [**Python-venv**](https://pypi.org/project/virtualenv/) - The installer will prompt you how to install it on your version

#### Additional MacOS (BigSur) requirements:
- Install [brew](https://brew.sh/)
- Install xcode util 12.3
- Install `hdf5` - *`brew install hdf5`*
- Install `c-blosc` - *`brew install c-blosc`*
- Install `tables` - *`pip3 install tables`*

## Installation instructions
MoniGoMani provides an all-in-one setup tool. It will guide you through the entire installation procedure. Not only for MoniGoMani, but Freqtrade also. You want the entire package, right? You will be up & HyperOpting (or Dry/Live Running) in no time! ü§ô

To run the `installer.sh`, just run the following command:
```powershell
/usr/bin/env sh <(curl -s "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rikj000/MoniGoMani/development/installer.sh")
```

After installation all you need to do to get started is run:

```powershell
cd ./freqtrade-mgm
python3 mgm-hurry up
```

That's it you successfully installed `MoniGoMani` and/or `Freqtrade`!
You can now start using `MoniGoMani` for HyperOpting/BackTesting/Dry/Live-running! Congratulations :tada:
This is only the beginning though, now please read the [Docs-MoniGoMani.md](https://monigomani.readthedocs.io/Docs-MoniGoMani) & [Docs-MGM-Hurry.md](https://monigomani.readthedocs.io/Docs-MGM-Hurry) to learn how to use it properly!

### Pro tip
Add an alias in the config file of your shell *(eg. ~/.zshrc)* so you can use MGM-Hurry as `mgm-hurry` without the need of pre-fixing Python in your commands anymore! :smile:
Following is a non-sticking example line, this needs to be added to your shell config:
```powershell
alias mgm-hurry="python3 /path/to/installation/freqtrade-mgm/mgm-hurry"
```

### OS Support Priority list

1) **Linux/Unix** *(MoniGoMani is written on Linux, for Linux!)*
2) **MacOS** *(Thanks to topscoder and other MacOS users)*
3) **WSL** *(Because we have to give those Windows users something..)*
4) **Docker** *(Perhaps someday, but not at this point in time..)*
5) **Windows** *(Such a SpyWare infested OS will **never** receive support for this project!)*
