# Parallel downloads - This, for now, is Kraken-only

# they rate limit by IP & quote pair, so even though they're quite aggressive on rate limits
# doing this in parallel by pair doesn't get rate limited IME, by default, one process per core
# since Kraken requires that the trade data is downloaded to generate candles > 720 but nprocs *2
# or even more parallelism is probably just fine on architectures like x64 with SMT, etc
#
# I have added this with a bit of thought towards allowing by-exchange parallelism if other exchanges
# have similar rate limiting, but this is outside my experience with other exchanges right now
